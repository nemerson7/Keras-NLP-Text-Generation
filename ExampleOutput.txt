Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving.   Shouldering a laconic good guy, neo Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience.   Central to the film's success is a riveting, unfussy performance from Robbins. Freeman has the showier role, allowing him a grace and dignity that come naturally.

It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was rightfully called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.
