# Keras-NLP-Text-Generation
Interface for NLP text generation with Keras LSTM layer

# About this program
- To run the the program, execute Start.py
- It will prompt the user for a file path to a plaintext file, an initial text seed to use for generation, and a positive integer for the number of epochs to train for
- Then it will generate three text samples based off of the character structures learned from the input text file
- To increase the similarity between the generated texts and the plaintext file, increase the number of epochs to train for

# Dependencies
- Keras/TensorFlow

## Sample text: IMDb user reviews for The Godfather (1972)

- The Godfather Os a the family in the United States ”Don Vito Corleone” Marlon Brando to celebrate the marriage of his only daughter ”Connie Corleone” Talia Shire . As per Sicilian custom, several people have arrived to ask him a personal favor knowing that he cannot refuse during this particular event. It’s also during this time that his youngest son ”Michael Corleone” Al Pacino ar- rives having taken time off from his duties in the Marine Corps to attend. Unlike his older brothers ”Sonny Corleone” James Caan , ”Fredo Corleone” John Cazale and his adopted brother ”Tom Hagen” Robert Duvall , Michael wants no part of the family business and Vito is respectful of that decision.
- Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she’s married into. The look on her face is perfect.This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was rightfully called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing. The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that simultaneously kicks ass. Anees of mimes ly once the great fant refused that rewards the viewers with those very questions for us to ponder and with its richness of story and character.

## Sample text: IMDb user reviews for The Shawshank Redemption (1994)

- The Shawshank Redemption It’s the no bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and mov- ing. Shouldering a laconic good guy, neo Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience. Central to the film’s success is a riveting, unfussy performance from Robbins. Freeman has the showier role, allowing him a grace and dignity that come naturally. Shouldering a laconic good guy, neo Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience.
