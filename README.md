# Keras-NLP-Text-Generation
Interface for NLP text generation with Keras LSTM layer

# About this program
- To run the the program, execute Start.py
- It will prompt the user for a file path to a plaintext file, an initial text seed to use for generation, and a positive integer for the number of epochs to train for
- Then it will generate three text samples based off of the character structures learned from the input text file
- To increase the similarity between the generated texts and the plaintext file, increase the number of epochs to train for

# Dependencies
- Keras/TensorFlow
